## Steps to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13 or higher
- Node.js and npm
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Backend Setup

#### Step 1: Create a Python Virtual Environment

**What is a Virtual Environment?**
A virtual environment is an isolated Python workspace where you can install project-specific dependencies without affecting your system Python installation.

1. **Navigate to the project root directory** (where the `backend` and `frontend` folders are)
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/HRMS
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/HRMS` with your actual project path.

2. **Create a virtual environment named `env`**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   ```
   This will create a new folder called `env` containing the isolated Python environment.

3. **Verify the virtual environment was created**
   ```bash
   ls -la env
   ```
   You should see folders like `bin`, `lib`, `include`, and `pyvenv.cfg`.

#### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

**Why activate?** 
Activation ensures that Python commands use the isolated environment instead of your system Python.

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bash
env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```bash
env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

You'll know it's activated when you see `(env)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

#### Step 3: Upgrade pip (Recommended)

It's a good idea to upgrade pip to the latest version:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Step 4: Install Project Dependencies

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install all required Python packages from `requirements.txt`**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will download and install all necessary packages (Django, Django REST Framework, etc.). This may take a few minutes.

#### Step 5: Configure the Database

1. **Apply database migrations** (creates database tables)
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Create a superuser account** (optional, for accessing Django admin panel)
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```
   Follow the prompts to create a username, email, and password.

#### Step 6: Run the Backend Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output like:
```
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

#### Step 7: Deactivate the Virtual Environment (When Done)

When you're finished working, deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
The `(env)` prefix will disappear from your terminal prompt.

### Frontend Setup

**Important:** Keep your backend server running (from Backend Setup Step 6) and open a new terminal for the frontend.

1. **Open a new terminal** (don't close the backend terminal)

2. **Navigate to the frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/HRMS/frontend
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/HRMS` with your actual project path.

3. **Check if Node.js and npm are installed**
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```
   If you don't have Node.js installed, download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

4. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will create a `node_modules` folder and install all required packages. This may take a few minutes.

5. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   You should see output like:
   ```
   Local:   http://localhost:5173/
   ```

6. **Open the frontend in your browser**
   Click on the URL (usually `http://localhost:5173/`) or paste it into your browser.

### Access the Application

Once both servers are running, you can access:
- **Frontend Application**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
---

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Assumptions
- Users will run both backend and frontend servers simultaneously for full functionality
- The database is initialized with Django migrations from the `emp` and `api` apps
- CORS is configured to allow requests between frontend and backend
- Python 3.13 is compatible with the current environment setup
- SQLite3 is sufficient for development and testing purposes

### Limitations
- **Database**: SQLite3 is used, which is suitable for development but not recommended for production environments with concurrent users
- **Scalability**: Current architecture is optimized for small to medium-scale deployments
- **Static Files**: Frontend is served from a development server; production deployment will require additional configuration
- **Authentication**: Basic authentication mechanisms may need enhancement for enterprise use
- **Data Persistence**: SQLite database file (`db.sqlite3`) is stored locally; requires backup strategies for data safety
